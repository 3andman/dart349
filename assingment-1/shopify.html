        <h1 class="article-title">Shopify Live Globe</h1>
        <h2 class="article-sub">An unbelievably entertaining interactive company recap.</h2>

        <p>Design: The interface uses bold, colourful visuals and dynamic moving elements to celebrate
        Shopify’s Black Friday/Cyber Monday data.<p>
        
        </p>Usability: Interactive and playful. Playing  pinball demo turning a basic set of data into an enjoyable experience. Though some of the fun details are hard to experience with a lack of explanation for controls .<p>
            
        </p>Content: The experience blends boring commerce data with visual storytelling, but it feels more like a game than just data, which I find to be a genuis way to reach the general public.<p>
            
        </p>Creativity: This is probably the most unconventional large company website you'll ever see, data displayed by an arcade machine, computer monitor and a spinnable globe, it's compelling for anyone who doesn't just care to see the numbers, and I'm sure the people who want to see them have other means to find them.<p>
            
        </p>Overall it’s exciting and playful, especially if you enjoy interactive visuals, it feels tailored to the average viewer and not just finance geeks.
